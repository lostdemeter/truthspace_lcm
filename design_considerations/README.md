# Design Considerations

This directory contains design documentation for TruthSpace LCM, capturing the research and reasoning behind key architectural decisions.

## Documents

1. **[001_intentional_vs_emergent_geometry.md](001_intentional_vs_emergent_geometry.md)**
   - Core problem: intentional vs emergent geometry in knowledge representation
   - Comparison of TruthSpace approach to LLMs
   - Proposal for hybrid approach using phase shifts

2. **[002_critical_analysis.md](002_critical_analysis.md)**
   - What LLMs learn vs what TruthSpace builds
   - Phase-shift hypothesis
   - Autotuner design space

3. **[003_vacuum_forming_hypothesis.md](003_vacuum_forming_hypothesis.md)**
   - Formalization of the "vacuum forming" hypothesis
   - LLM training as capturing the surface of semantic structure
   - How phase shifts could reveal interior structure

4. **[004_experiment_design.md](004_experiment_design.md)**
   - Detailed experiment plans to test the vacuum forming hypothesis
   - Phase-shift consistency, LLM embedding alignment, surface reconstruction

5. **[005_experimental_results.md](005_experimental_results.md)**
   - Results from hypothesis testing experiments
   - Evidence for interior structure: zero variance, polarity encoding, orthogonality

6. **[006_dimensionality_findings.md](006_dimensionality_findings.md)**
   - Why plastic constant shows stronger separation than φ
   - Analysis of optimal dimensions (8D vs 12D)
   - Orthogonality exploitation for autotuning

## Key Findings

- **Plastic constant (ρ ≈ 1.3247)** provides finer semantic discrimination than golden ratio
- **12D encoding** captures temporal, causal, conditional, and comparative relationships
- **Orthogonal dimensions** enable independent tuning - collisions only matter within a dimension
- **Phase invariance** suggests the structure is fundamental, not arbitrary
